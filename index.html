                                            In HTTP/1.0 and since, the first line of the HTTP response is called the status line and includes a numeric status code (e.g 404)
                                            and a textual reason phrase (such as "Not Found"). The way the user agent handles the response primarily depends on the code and
                                            secondarily on the other response header fields. Custom status codes can be used since, if the user agent encounters a code it
                                            does not recognize, it can use the first digit of the code to determine the general class of the response.

                                                    to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was "Moved Temporarily"), but popular browsers implemented 302

                                                    However, some Web applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303.
