                    What is <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>?

                    <p>
                        HTTP is the underlying protocol used by World Wide Web (WWW) and this protocol defines how messages
                        are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to
                        various commands.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For example, when you enter a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> in your browser,
                        this actually sends an HTTP command to the Web server directing it to fetch and transmit the requested Web page.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section id="difference-between-http-and-https">
                <h2>How does <abbr title="HTTP Secure">HTTPS</abbr> differ from HTTP?</h2>

                <div class="text-group">
                    <p>
                        HTTPS is a protocol for secure communications over HTTP protocol that is encrypted by
                        <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr>/<abbr title="Secure Sockets Layer">SSL</abbr>
                    </p>

                    <p>HTTP on the other hand offers no traffic encryption thus sending data in its plain text form.</p>
                </div>

            <section id="http-request-formation">

                    <li>The client enters the URL in the browser.</li>
                    <li>
                        The browser looks up the <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> for the domain name.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The browser sends a HTTP request to the web server by establishing a <abbr title="Transmission Control Protocol">TCP</abbr>
                        reliable connection with the Web Server and then transfer the request via this connection.
                    </li>

                <ol class="list">
                    <li>The web server waits for a HTTP request to be sent to them for processing.</li>
                    <li>
                        The server analyzes and interprets the HTTP request and executes the corresponding action based on the HTTP verb present on the request.
                    </li>
                    <li>After the server, processed and executed the action it sends a response back to the client.</li>
