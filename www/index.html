                                        In HTTP/1.0 and since, the first line of the HTTP response is called the status line and includes a numeric status code (e.g 404)
                                        and a textual reason phrase (such as "Not Found"). The way the user agent handles the response primarily depends on the code and
                                        secondarily on the other response header fields. Custom status codes can be used since, if the user agent encounters a code it
                                        does not recognize, it can use the first digit of the code to determine the general class of the response.

                                                This prevents the client from timing out and assuming the request was lost.

                                                This is an example of industry practice contradicting the standard. The HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) required the client
                                                to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was "Moved Temporarily"), but popular browsers implemented 302
                                                with the functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours.
                                                However, some Web applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303.

                                                The response to the request can be found under another URI using a GET method. When received in response to a POST (or PUT/DELETE),
                                                the client should presume that the server has received the data and should issue a redirect with a separate GET message.

                                                Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the version specified by the request headers If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match.
                                                In such case, there is no need to retransmit the resource since the client still has a previously-downloaded copy.

                                                The requested resource is available only through a proxy, the address for which is provided in the response.
                                                Many HTTP clients (such as Mozilla and Internet Explorer) do not correctly handle responses with this status code, primarily for security reasons.

                                                In this case, the request should be repeated with another URI; however, future requests should still use the original URI.
                                                In contrast to how 302 was historically implemented, the request method is not allowed to be changed when reissuing the
                                                original request. For example, a POST request should be repeated using another POST request.

                                                The request and all future requests should be repeated using another URI. 307 and 308 parallel the behaviours of 302 and 301,
                                                but do not allow the HTTP method to change. So, for example, submitting a form to a permanently redirected resource may continue smoothly.

                                                the client should not request the resource in the future. Clients such as search engines should remove the resource
                                                from their indices. Most use cases do not require clients and search engines to purge the resource, and a "404 Not Found"
                                                may be used instead.

                                                The URI provided was too long for the server to process. Often the result of too much data being encoded as a query-string
                                                of a GET request, in which case it should be converted to a POST request. Called "Request-URI Too Long" previously.

                                                The request entity has a media type which the server or resource does not support. For example, the client uploads an
                                                image as image/svg+xml, but the server requires that images use a different format.

                                                The client has asked for a portion of the file (byte serving), but the server cannot supply that portion. For example,
                                                if the client asked for a part of the file that lies beyond the end of the file. Called "Requested Range Not Satisfiable" previously.

                                                This code was defined in 1998 as one of the traditional IETF April Fools' jokes, in RFC 2324, Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol,
                                                and is not expected to be implemented by actual HTTP servers. The RFC specifies this code should be returned by tea pots
                                                requested to brew coffee. This HTTP status is used as an easter egg in some websites, including Google.com.

                                                the state on the server, leading to a conflict."
